        | The Project

      p
        | Berlin is a wonderful city. So vivid, multicultural, full of history and with so many secret spots.

      p
        | However,
        |
        span.text-accent
          | sometimes finding the right place for the right mood is so hard
        | , even harder when you are looking for a romantic place. It has to be nice, but not uptight; it needs good music, but not too loud; cool drinks and a good menu, but nothing too classy; with fancy people, but not too crowded.

      p
        | So here you can find a small selection of romantic spots: some of them are perfect for a brunch or a coffee, some other are for the evening with drinks and music. You can also find bars or outdoors places where drinking a beer while waiting for the sunset.

      P
        | Hopefully you will find here your romantic place.

        | The Name

      p
        span.text-accent
          | Why Zitronenstrasse?
        |
        | It’s just a name of a street? It’s real one? What does it mean?

      p
        | Well, here is the story.

      p
        | Zitronenstrasse is an
        |
        span.text-accent
          | inside joke between two languages
        |, German and Italian.

      p
        | Italians know well what a
        |
        i
          | limone
        |
        | (literally:
        |
        i
          | lemon
        |) is: it's a slang word for
        |
        i
          | making out (limonare)
        |.

      p
        | Being in Germany we thought about
        |
        i
          | The street of lemons
        |
        | in the local language:
        |
        i
          | Zitronen-strasse
        |, the romantic street for (hopefully) making out.

      p
        | So I decided to create this website to collect all the nice romantic places I've found and play with new frontend languages.

      p
